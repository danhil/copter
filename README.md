Experiments with a Raspberry pi based segway/quadcopter where a pic32 processor is utilized
for excecuting the control algorithm (probably a PID derivative). 
The components that are utilized in this project :

    *Raspberry pi revB 512mb,
    *Microchip microstick II,  DM330013-2 pic32 dev board,
    *MPU-6050, Triple Axis Accelerometer & Gyro Breakout Triple Axis Accelerometer & Gyro Breakout,

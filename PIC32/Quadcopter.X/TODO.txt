TODO

Change PWM duty cycle input signal from 0-100 into 0-1000 for better resolution.

Set up 4 PWM outputs and test them.
    Can all PWM outputs use the same timer? (Timer 2 or Timer 3)

Set up I2C and test it.
    Found problem with I2C Frequency.
    See page 19 in I2C-doc.
    See C:\Program Files (x86)\Microchip\xc32\v1.30\pic32-libs\peripheral\i2c\source\I2CSetFrequency.c
    Maybe a good solution requires 50MHz clock?


Test external 20 MHz crystal. Remember to change the configuration bits!

Learn more about interrupts. For example, what is ipl7??

Buy UART/USB converter for debugging PIC32MX

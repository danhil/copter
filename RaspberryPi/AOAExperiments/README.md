An attempt to run the rpi with the linux ADK package as a first
draft regulating device for a segway.
Requirements to be installed to /usr/local/include/
As of now:
libusbx (fork of libusb-1.0)
bcm2835 library for controlling the Rpi gpio ports (ver 1.0.35 is used.)

This project is an attempt to use an android device and its associated sensros to enable cheap access to regulating H/W.
By coupling this to a raspberry pi analog outputs can be controlled and used.
